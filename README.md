# Pong

This program will create the game Pong. This is considered to be the first ever computer game. 

## Getting Started

As you walk through the script, you will find the creation of three important parts.
    1. The paddles
    2. The ball
    3. The interactions between the ball and the wall and paddles

## Prerequisites

You will need 5 packages to use this script. You will need to down load pygames, sys and time.
Pygames is what everything will be built with.
sys is used to exit the game once certain criteria is met
time is used to sleep the script after the game loops through an iteration
```
import pygame, sys, time
from pygame.locals import *
from random import randint
```

## Deployment

In order to run the game, simply execute the entire script and the pygame console will pop up on the screen. The game will start after about 3 seconds.
